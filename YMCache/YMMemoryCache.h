/** The YMMemoryCache class declares a programatic interface to objects that manage ephemeral
 * associations of keys and values, similar to Foundation's NSMutableDictionary. The primary benefit
 * is that YMMemoryCache is designed to be safely accessed and mutated across multiple threads. It
 * offers specific optimizations for use in a multi-threaded environment, and hides certain functionality
 * that may be potentially unsafe or behave in unexpected ways for users accustomed to an NSDictionary.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 *
 * In general, non-mutating access (getters) execute synchronously and in parallel (by way of a concurrent
 * Grand Central Dispatch queue).
 * Mutating access (setters), on the other hand, take advantage of dispatch barriers to provide safe,
 * blocking writes while preserving in-band synchronous-like ordering behavior.
 *
 * In other words, getters behave as if they were run on a concurrent dispatch queue with respect to
 * each other. However, setters behave as though they were run on a serial dispatch queue with respect
 * to both getters and other setters.
 *
 * One side effect of this approach is that any access – even a non-mutating getter – may result in a
 * blocking call, though overall latency should be extremely low. Users should plan for this and try
 * to pull out all values at once (via `enumerateKeysAndObjectsUsingBlock`) or in the background.
